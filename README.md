## Summary
The article I selected is titled "How to write a good software deisgn document." I chose this because while document writing can sometimes seem tedious, clear, concise documentation can make a world of difference when jumping on a new project. Rather than being lengthy or convoluted, good documentation stands out when it can provide all the necessary information efficiently. 

Some sections that the article recommends you consider when writing a docuement include: the title and people involved, a project overview, the context of the project/problem, the goals, what the goals are not, milestones, the existing solutions, alternative solutions considered, testability monitoring & alerting, cross team impact, open questions, and a detailed scope and timeline. 

While this may seem like much, some writing tips include adding vial elements like charts/diagrams, using simple words and short sentences, bulleted lists, and concrete examples to explain ambiguity. Finally, whenever possible include numbers to identify the scale of the solution.
